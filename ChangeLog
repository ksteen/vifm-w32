	Quick view of current file with :view command.

	Hopefully fixed bug when starting vifm with a directory on the command

	waits for the process to return so that the changes show up quicker 
	in the file lists.

	Removed the code to change the xterm title.

	User commands and the builtin commands now work with <Tab> expansion.

	:! and :!! now work with tab expansion.

	Changed waitpid to a loop.
