~~~~~~~~~~~~
You need:

	If you want to compile the source code you will need:
	Mingw
	Pdcurses for Mingw
	Regex for Mingw
	


Vim Specific Options:

	If you use vim, copy the vifm.txt file in the vifm/src directory to 
	your ~/.vim/doc directory or the system vim/doc directory. 
	Then launch vim ahd give the command
	:helptags ~/.vim/doc
	or
	:helptags path/to/system/vim/doc 
	depending on where you installed the vifm.txt file.

	You will also need to change the USE_VIM_HELP
	in ~/.vifm/vifmrc as the default setting is to use the plain text file.

	If you want to use the vifm.vim plugin, copy the vifm.vim plugin script to 
	either the system wide vim/plugin or to ~/.vim/plugin/.  The vifm.vim script 
	allows you to use vifm from vim to select files.  The vifm.vim script is not
	installed by default and must be manually copied to the plugin directory.
